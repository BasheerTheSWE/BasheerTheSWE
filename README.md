- ***❝Master Your Voice.❞***
- SayItRight helps non-native English speakers improve their pronunciation through live practice sessions. Users read aloud, get real-time feedback on mispronounced words, and track their progress over time.
- I designed it for people like me, who wanted to speak clearly without sounding robotic. It's solving a personal problem that I'm facing (making me patient 0).

  🏆 For a period of exactly one day, it was ranking #4 in Hong Kong 🇭🇰 and #2 in Taiwan 🇹🇼

- ***❝Create Brainrot Videos.❞***
- Optimized for short-form content (TikTok, Reels, Shorts).
- Most content creators nowadays are making short-form content and relying on "brain rot" formats to get views and engagement. That's why I'm building this app, to give creators a tool that doesn't require a monthly subscription like the others (just a one-time payment) and is offering exactly what they want (templates covering the most commonly used "brain rot" formats).
